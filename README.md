# material-design-tables
This table component was designed to help anyone building a product that adheres to the Material Design spec. I added the scrolling behaviour to the table for kicks after reading an article called [Design better data tables](https://medium.com/nextux/design-better-data-tables-4ecc99d23356) by Andrew Coyle.
 

## Working with Sketch:

Sketch version 55.2 + is required to open all 3 Sketch files. The MD Table `.sketch` file is your working file and contains the table designs. If you do not have Sketch installed, instructions to do so can be found on the [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) website. 

This folder will contain 3 Sketch files
- MD Table
- MD Library 
- MD Icons Filled

### Setting up the Sketch libraries:

1. Open the MD Table `.sketch` file
2. Open Preferences and select Add Library from the Preferences window
3. Open the MD Library and MD Icons Filled `.sketch` files located in the folder
4. Close the Preferences window
 
The MD Table `.sketch` file will now have access to a theme library (MD Library) and an icon library (MD Icons Filled). Navigating to the Insert menu in Sketch will show these Libraries under Symbols and Text Styles. 

For more information on how to use Sketch libraries please read: [A beginner's guide to Sketch Libraries](https://medium.com/sketch-app-sources/a-beginners-guide-to-sketch-libraries-5f431d91f657)

Please note: The MD Library file contains Material Design components, typography and colours. The MD Icons Filled file contains Material Design system icons. The table was designed using both files. discontinued

## Material Design Theme Editor:

The Material Design guidelines can be found on the [Material Design](https://material.io/design/guidelines-overview/) website. 

Material Design previously released a Theme Editor plugin for Sketch. The MD Library and MD Icons Filled `sketch` files were generated from the plugin which has now unfortunately been discontinued.
